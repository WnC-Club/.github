Welcome to our organization! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to any of our repositories. We value every contribution and want to make your experience as smooth as possible.

## Our Values

## Getting Started with Our Organization

1. Browse our repositories to find projects that interest you
2. Read the project-specific README.md file
3. Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
4. Join our community channels (if available) to connect with other contributors

## Organization-Wide Guidelines

### Git Workflow

1. **Fork & Clone**
   - Fork the repository you want to contribute to
   - Clone your fork locally
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repository-name
   ```

2. **Branching Strategy**
   We use the following branch naming convention:
   ```
   type/description-in-kebab-case
   ```
   Types:
   - `feature/` - New features
   - `fix/` - Bug fixes
   - `docs/` - Documentation updates
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
   - `test/` - Test additions or updates

### Commit Standards

We follow conventional commits across all our projects:

```
type(scope): brief description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
```
feat(auth): implement SSO login
fix(ui): correct button alignment
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

Common types:
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Formatting changes
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

### Pull Request Process

1. **Before Creating a PR**
   - Ensure your code follows our style guidelines
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add/update tests if needed
   - Run all tests locally

2. **PR Title Format**
   ```
   type: brief description of changes
   ```

3. **PR Description Template**
